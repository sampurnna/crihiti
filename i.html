            COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION DOMAIN
        <div class="text">
            Communication and education go hand in hand. Communication is the way to share information and education is learning information. Communication is very important for education as it is required to spread knowledge among everyone. Communication can be-
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Verbal - share by talking with people

                </li>
                <li>
                    Non verbal - explaining things through gestures, expressions and signs

                </li>
                <li>
                    Written - sharing knowledge by writing like through circulars, notices or messages

                </li>
                <li>
                    Visual - speaking through pictures like graphs and images.
                </li>
            </ol>
       It is important that information is communicated effectively, that the receiver receives the information correctly and easily. For this education is needed. One should know how to communicate with everyone, how to present the knowledge. Hence proving how both go hand in hand. While communicating, one should have a knowledge of the audience so they know how to present such that everyone gets the information correctly, clearly and easily.
Crihti believes in having effective communication and education for everyone and in teaching the same. Hence we inform students about the importance of quality education and effective communication and together learn how to do it.
