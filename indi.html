       SCIENCE OF TEXTILE & CRAFT DOMAIN
       <div class="text">
           Food, cloth and shelter - these are said to be the basic needs of a person. Everyone talks about the importance of food and shelter but seldom does one speak about clothes. Thus it becomes essential to understand the need for clothes. This is where textile science comes into play. 
Textile science speaks about the development of clothes, how they are made, what all kinds of materials are used and their benefits. It includes study of topics like dyeing, printing and weaving. The process of developing a fabric is quite complex as it has to go through a series of processes. Hence textile science that holds a prominent place in the field.
Understanding a fabric’s physical, chemical and biological properties is vital for making a cloth. As every fabric is different from the other in its properties, a thorough fabric analysis is important. This understanding that is highly important in fashion designing helps designers to make a sensible choice of choosing fabrics that complement their design.
We aim at making knowledge of clothes as important as any other utility’s knowledge and spread awareness about the same.
