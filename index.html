            Human development is the process of expanding people's freedoms and opportunities and improving their well-being. Human development is about the real freedom ordinary people have to decide who to be, what to do, and how to live. The human development concept, developed by economist Mahbub ul Haq, has broadly six pillars :
            <ul>
                <li>
                     Equity - equal rights for everyone
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sustainability - right to earn and get equal distribution of goods

                </li>
                <li>
                    Productivity - Full participation of people in income generation and more efficient social programs for people by the government

                </li>
                <li>
                     Empowerment - freedom to influence development and decision that affect them
                </li>
                <li>
                     Cooperation - participation of all communities and groups

                </li>
                <li>
                     Security - Power to offer development opportunities freely and safely

                    
                </li>
            </ul>
            The three basic indicators of human development are life expectancy, per capita income and education, and these factors only help evaluate the development of a country.
We at Crihti explore these pillars, stages and indicators, understand the importance of it on individual and country level and spread awareness about it.
