        FOOD & NUTRITION DOMAIN
        <div class="text">
            Food plays an integral role in our lives. It provides fuel needed to do day to day activities. So it becomes very important to eat right. It is seen that people with healthy eating habits tend to live longer and have a lower risk for serious health issues. WHO states that a healthy diet should include following-
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Fresh fruits and vegetable
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fat intake reduced to 30% of total energy intake
                </li>
                <li>
                    Less salt intake
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduced sugar intake
                </li>
            </ol>
            Regular water consumption is also essential for the body. Other vital components needed are protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and fibres. Getting insufficient nutrients can result in deficiencies.
            Among others.
